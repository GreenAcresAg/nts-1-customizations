The appearance and user interface of the [Nu:Tekt NTS-1 digital kit](https://www.korg.com/products/synthesizers/nts_1) synthesizer can be customized by replacing the front panel with a custom created one. This site provides the base material and guidance for the creation of such custom panels.

## Reference Custom Panel Design

We provide an open hardware reference panel design that can be used as a template for the creation of original NTS-1 panel designs. 

![Reference Custom Panel Design Rev.B](/assets/NTS-1_ref_cp_revb_front.jpg)

Schematics, bill of materials, CAD and PCB data for the reference design are available [here](https://github.com/korginc/NTS-1-customizations/tree/master/CustomPanel_RevB)

The reference panel design is compatible with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) via a dedicated board definition package. See [Programming](doc/programming/) for details.
